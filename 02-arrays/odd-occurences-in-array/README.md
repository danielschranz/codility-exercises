## Exercise

Given an array A of integers find the return the element that can't be paired with another element of the same value.

## Examples

    [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9] => 7

## Deliverable

Write a function:

function solution(array);

that returns the value of the only unpaired element in the array.

## Assumptions

- the given array is not empty and has an odd number of elements in the range of (1..1,000,000)
- all values come in pairs except one single element

## Complexity

- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.

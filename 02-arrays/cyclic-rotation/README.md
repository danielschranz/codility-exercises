## Exercise

Return an array that has been rotate a given number of times.

## Examples

    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] rotated once    => [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] rotated 3 times => [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]

## Deliverable

Write a function:

function solution(array, rotations);

## Assumptions

- the length of the array and the number of rotations are numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive)
- each entry in the array is a number from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive)

## Complexity

no complexity constraints

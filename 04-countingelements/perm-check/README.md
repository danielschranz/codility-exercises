## Exercise

Given an array of length N check if it is a permutation (contains all elements from 1 to N)

## Deliverable

Write a function:

    function solution(A);

that returns 1 if the array is a permutation and 0 otherwise.

## Examples

    A = [4, 1, 3]     => 0
    A = [4, 1, 3, 2]  => 1


## Assumptions

- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- each element of the array is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

## Complexity

- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (storage for input doesn't count)

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
